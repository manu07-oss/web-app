## Introduction

This project is a sample web application designed to demonstrate various aspects of modern application development and deployment practices. It includes features for user management, data storage, and integration with monitoring and logging tools.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for user data
- Dockerized application for easy deployment
- Kubernetes configurations for scalable deployment
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring metrics
- ELK Stack for centralized logging

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Elasticsearch
- Logstash
- Kibana

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Docker
- Kubernetes (optional, for Kubernetes deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/web-app.git
   cd web-app
2.Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
## Usage
  1.Start the application locally:
     ```bash
    npm start
  2.Open your browser and go to 'http://localhost:3000' to view the application.
### Deployment
##Local Deployment
For local development, you can use Docker Compose:
1.Build and start the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
2.Access the application at ' http://localhost:3000'.
## Deployment to Kubernetes
Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster using 'kubectl':
1.Apply Kubernetes configurations:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
## Monitoring and Logging
Monitor your application with Prometheus and Grafana:
1.Apply Prometheus and Grafana configurations:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus-deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f k8s/grafana-deployment.yaml

2.Access Grafana dashboard at 'http://localhost:3000' (or your Kubernetes cluster IP).
View logs with the ELK Stack:
1.Apply Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana configurations:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/elasticsearch-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/logstash-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/kibana-deployment.yaml
## CI/CD Pipeline:
The CI/CD pipeline is set up with GitHub Actions:

On each push to the 'main' branch, the pipeline builds the Docker image, pushes it to Docker Hub, and deploys it to Kubernetes.
